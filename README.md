# ml_intrusion_system
The objectives of the intrusion detection model using ml on big data environment are: • To provide spark-chi-svm model for intrusion detection that can deal with big data • To provide a high performance and reducing the training time and efficient algorithm for big data • Reduce the computations, to provide high speed and a low of false positive alarms rate • To provide optimal algorithm for the considered dataset to get the highest precision.
