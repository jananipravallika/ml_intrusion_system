# ml_intrusion_system
The objectives of the intrusion detection model using ml
on big data environment are: 
• To provide spark-chi-svm model for intrusion detection that can deal with big 
data
• To provide a high performance and reducing the training time and efficient 
algorithm for big data
• Reduce the computations, to provide high speed and a low of false positive alarms 
rate
• To provide optimal algorithm for the considered dataset to get the highest 
precision.
